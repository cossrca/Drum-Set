# 🥁 Drum Set  
A fully interactive drum set built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can play sounds by clicking on-screen buttons or pressing mapped keyboard keys — delivering a smooth, responsive musical experience.

## 💡 What I Learned  
- Used a `switch` statement to dynamically trigger different drum sounds based on key input  
- Applied higher-order functions by attaching event listeners to each button using `forEach`-like iteration  
- Improved understanding of DOM traversal (`querySelectorAll`) and dynamic event binding  
- Gained experience in audio playback, code reusability, and real-time interactivity

## 🚀 Features  
- Key-to-sound mapping with instant audio playback  
- Clickable drum pads with responsive feedback  
- Animated button effects on key press or mouse click  
- Mobile-friendly layout and fast load time  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **HTML5** — Semantic structure  
- **CSS3** — Flexbox layout and animations  
- **JavaScript** — DOM scripting and event handling
